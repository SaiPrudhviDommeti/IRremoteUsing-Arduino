# IRremoteUsing-Arduino
this is a IR based Arduino project used for home automation.
This project is mainly take place in 2 steps.
In this project we first take the Hexa values of a remote keys by uploading a code to read IR value code. This can be done by using IRdataReceiver code. Just run that code and connect your IR sensor to mentioned pin in the code
just take all the hexa values of all keys and paste it on a notepad.
now assign a command to each key
And then we will give this command to the arduino that what it has to be done when a that key press that switch.
one have to specify the output that has to be turned on.
